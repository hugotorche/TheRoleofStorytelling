176,176,"I have been a customer of L'Occitane for many years and have often used them to send gifts. I doubt I will bother returning after my latest experience. I ordered a 50th birthday present for a friend, including a personal note as I couldn't see her in person. Due to it being December, I thought it may be slightly delayed. I was able to order the gift and given no indication that it may be out of stock. After almost a week I had heard nothing re delivery. At first there was no movement in my account, and then it said 'picking' for a few days. I emailed customer services but received no reply. My friend's birthday has been and gone. Yesterday I checked online and the order said cancelled. This morning I got a Paypal refund. Eight days after my order and I have yet to receive any communication from the company. I have just called customer services and was told they had emailed me to inform me the product was out of stock. Please don't blatantly lie to your customers. It isn't in spam. It was never sent! I was then told that I could order something else and they would give me free next day delivery. Wow! That really makes up for missing a friend's birthday, which they have had to spend alone due to the current situation. If you can't cope with demand, then limit the number of orders per day on your website.

Lo and behold, they informed me they cancelled 2 of the same items in my order because they were OUT OF STOCK and they would therefore not be delivered. First of all: 1) when I completed my purchase, there were still 8 in stock on the website, 2) no one informed me about my cancelled order/OSS items, 3) no communication about a refund on these OSS items, and 4) I had to chase them down to find out and with no remedy provided or a simple gesture (honoring the same discount to the non-limited edition version of the same item) to rectify this (these were supposed to be Christmas presents!). I'm disappointed and will likely not return for another purchase (I now remember why I stopped purchasing from them; my last purchase prior to this was 4 years ago). For the price of their products and the marketed brand as a luxurious/high-end skincare line, their customer service does not reflect this. They can't even get their POS working correctly and efficiently;  something other high-end/luxurious skincare lines seems to have nailed down (based on my experience with other e-orders/purchases with them) and the after-sale customer service, as other reviewers have pointed out, is just horrible.

250,250,"I had an extremely bad experience with L'occitane.I recently bought a Cedrat Stick Deodorant for £17.50 from the Canary Wharf store. I decided to return it today after two uses, because I'd noticed that the scent disappeared after a few hours. I gave L'occitane the benefit of the doubt, because I assumed it was a bad batch, and returned it.  When I arrived in store, I explained the situation to the lady at the counter, who immediately and abruptly refused to refund the product because it'd been opened. I explained that I was of the opinion it was faulty, and pointed out that a £1 stick of deodorant from the local supermarket lasted longer than this product. Instead of just refunding the product, the lady then rudely said that she wears the deodorant, and that it's not faulty. She also took it upon herself to smell the deodorant stick I'd bought and again said it wasn't faulty and that there was no damage. She said that unless I'd had an allergy or there was damage, she wouldn't give a full refund. I respectfully told her that she was wearing a different deodorant stick, so couldn't comment on if the one I'd bought was faulty. I also pointed out that as I was the one who'd been wearing it all day, I was in the best position to say if it was working or not. I again advised that perhaps the deodorant was from a bad batch. The lady then walked over to the display where there were the other deodorants, and told me that they were all from the same batch, and that the other ones were fine. I again pointed out that the one I'd bought was not, and that she couldn't comment on any of them, until they'd been worn. I suggested that customer services might want to do a proper investigation into the entire batch, and asked her if she was accusing me of lying. She said she wasn't. At this point, she said she'd call customer services, and went into the back. She then came out, and told me that she'd refund it. As part of the refund, she took it upon herself to take back the welcome card I'd been given and didn't apologise for her behaviour. I left the store extremely shaken and upset. I feel that from the second I went into the store, I was treated with suspicion, contempt and rudeness. I feel that given that L'occitane is supposed to be a high end store, and it sells high end goods, that when someone makes a reasonable observation about the quality of the goods, the product should be refunded without an argument. I wouldn't recommend the Canary Wharf store because of this. I complained to L'occitane, and it appears I've now got a resolution from them, which is good.

257,257,"I received very poor customer service at L’occitane, Rushden Lakes, England. Whilst browsing in the store, I mentioned to the sales assistant  - Gill Bradley - that the ‘Fabulous Oil’ has a similar fragrance to the ‘70% Shea Butter’, both of which I already own and love. I was trying to find out what gives it that lovely fragrance. She told me that that  fragrance is the natural smell of Shea butter. I corrected her and stated that pure Shea butter has a strong nutty smell, however, obviously, L’occitane’s Shea butter has gone through a treatment process to remove the smell and the ‘70% Butter’ is replaced with the lovely fragrance that I had aforementioned, and was trying to find out about. Instead of listening, Gill insisted that the odour I was detecting was the smell of ‘natural’ Shea butter; she also dismissively concluded that her L’occitane training told her as such. It was clear that she didn’t know about the brand’s Shea product and was visibly irritated that I was correcting her. Not once did I raise my voice or shout at all. I just loved the fragrance and was genuinely trying to be complimentary and have a pleasant conversation. At that point, I asked to speak to a manager because I didn’t appreciate her tone. She stated that she was in charge of the store. I told her that I was very dissatisfied with her manner and wished to formally complain.Instead of facing up to her cold manner with me, she chose to speak over me by repeating herself constantly about the ‘training’ she had received with regards to Shea butter. I was staggered by her ‘sorry not sorry’ attitude. I felt no warmth; I received no smile during my shopping experience today. Instead, Gill was abrupt and apathetic. If she had  just taken the time to listen to me, then it would not have led to this negative situation.I spend a lot of money at L’occitane and have always encountered very professional and pleasant members of staff at Rushden Lakes. Unfortunately, last Friday was my first encounter with Gill and I was utterly appalled at her rude tone and unfriendly manner, so much so that I was entirely put off spending any money at the shop. I left, feeling awkward, antagonised and perplexed.Gill must re-evaluate her front of house manner with customers; she must remember that she’s representing the L’occitane brand. Gill must also review her knowledge on the brand’s Shea product. It’s utterly fruitless to call oneself a sales assistant; to sell products to customers when one’s knowledge about L’occitane’s products are limited or entirely incorrect.The apathy of Gill put me off shopping in the Rushden Lakes store again.",i received very poor customer service at loccitane rushden lakes england whilst browsing in the store i mentioned to the sales assistant  gill bradley  that the fabulous oil has a similar fragrance to the  shea butter both of which i already own and love i was trying to find out what gives it that lovely fragrance she told me that that fragrance is the natural smell of shea butter i corrected her and stated that pure shea butter has a strong nutty smell however obviously loccitanes shea butter has gone through a treatment process to remove the smell and the  butter is replaced with the lovely fragrance that i had aforementioned and was trying to find out about instead of listening gill insisted that the odour i was detecting was the smell of natural shea butter she also dismissively concluded that her loccitane training told her as such it was clear that she didnt know about the brands shea product and was visibly irritated that i was correcting her not once did i raise my voice or shout at all i just loved the fragrance and was genuinely trying to be complimentary and have a pleasant conversation at that point i asked to speak to a manager because i didnt appreciate her tone she stated that she was in charge of the store i told her that i was very dissatisfied with her manner and wished to formally complaininstead of facing up to her cold manner with me she chose to speak over me by repeating herself constantly about the training she had received with regards to shea butter i was staggered by her sorry not sorry attitude i felt no warmth i received no smile during my shopping experience today instead gill was abrupt and apathetic if she had just taken the time to listen to me then it would not have led to this negative situationi spend a lot of money at loccitane and have always encountered very professional and pleasant members of staff at rushden lakes unfortunately last friday was my first encounter with gill and i was utterly appalled at her rude tone and unfriendly manner so much so that i was entirely put off spending any money at the shop i left feeling awkward antagonised and perplexedgill must reevaluate her front of house manner with customers she must remember that shes representing the loccitane brand gill must also review her knowledge on the brands shea product its utterly fruitless to call oneself a sales assistant to sell products to customers when ones knowledge about loccitanes products are limited or entirely incorrectthe apathy of gill put me off shopping in the rushden lakes store again,2019-10-30,2,0.088,0.815,0.097,0.8485,0.97860634

So why not try to reorder it for me? Why not try to offer me some sort of discount for my troubles? I explained that this was a birthday gift for my mother and that this was extremely troubling to me as a long time customer of their brand, but they did not seem to care.",loccitane has a sneaky portion of their terms and conditions that states that they can cancel any order at any time i placed an order on  and apparently that order was canceled on  i never received a written notice or confirmation of my order being canceled when i realized that i never received a shipping notice i called customer service to ask about the order i was told that there were discrepancies in my information but they could not pinpoint what the issue was according to my order confirmation all of my shipping billing and credit card information was  correct i never received the cancellation email the customer service rep made no effort to remedy the situation or turn the situation around i was literally told over and over again that regrettably the order has been canceled so why not try to reorder it for me why not try to offer me some sort of discount for my troubles i explained that this was a birthday gift for my mother and that this was extremely troubling to me as a long time customer of their brand but they did not seem to care,2019-06-21,5,0.112,0.852,0.036,-0.9341,0.94856846

271,271,"I got a sample of their hand cream 20 years ago and have been hooked on their products ever since.  Absolutely first class quality and concentrated so a little goes a long way.I recently overhauled my entire house and the verbena hand wash and cream in green matched my new kitchen which is accessorised in lime green and the blue coloured lavander hand wash and cream match my new bathroom colour scheme.  I always receive my goods promptly when ordering online.  My only gripe with online orders is the lack of samples.  When I buy their stuff in Paris where I work,  I often end up with so many samples, many of which I end up buying in large sizes anyway.  I must lastly thank Rebecca for her truly warm and outstanding service when I visited the St Christopher's Place (London) outlet on Wednesday including the samples which I intend to buy in larger sizes.
