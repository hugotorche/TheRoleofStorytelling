## **Abstract**

This paper investigates the Role of Storytelling in Brand Communication. The Literature Review uses a Structured Analysis and Design Technique to reveal the theoretical framework of Storytelling related to humans, brands, and premium brands. For these brands, Storytelling has become an important leverage for growth and we analyzed this opportunity by addressing the impact of Storytelling on Brand Performance. This investigation includes narratives, stakeholders plurality, and stock price variation. 

We take the brand L’Occitane en Provence as an example for the research. We also analyze two markets, UK and Japan, to compare the Storytelling differences between two different contexts. The investigation includes the two most recent forms of Storytelling:
writing and digital. 

We collect data using WebScraping and APIs to have the multiple voices from a brand’s storytelling: employees, customers, foundation, etc. We perform Natural Language Processing tasks to get the sentiment and frequency of each corpus. Finally, Data Science methods were employed to identify the brand’s archetypes and performance correlation with Storytelling.

The results show that narratives are different between markets and can be subject to multiple archetypes. At the same time, we find that the brand’s narrative reflects the customer, which is the most impacting stakeholders for brand’s performance. The analysis confirms that aligning all stakeholders, particularly employees and community, around a common storytelling is a challenge for most of the large brands.

Finally, correlation between storytelling and brand’s performance isn’t significant. We challenge the stock price as an appropriate metric to evaluate performance and give additional inputs for further research on the topic.
